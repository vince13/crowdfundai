# Backup System Documentation

## Overview
The backup system provides comprehensive data protection for the AI Crowdfunding platform, ensuring the safety and recoverability of critical data.

## Features
- Full system backups
- Database-only backups
- Media file backups
- Configuration backups
- Backup verification
- Restore functionality
- Backup monitoring and logging

## Backup Types

### 1. Full Backup
- Includes database, media files, and configuration
- Command: `python manage.py backup --type full`
- Default backup type if none specified
- Recommended frequency: Daily

### 2. Database Backup
- Backs up the entire database
- Command: `python manage.py backup --type db`
- Supports SQLite, PostgreSQL, and MySQL
- Recommended frequency: Every 6 hours

### 3. Media Backup
- Backs up user-uploaded files
- Command: `python manage.py backup --type media`
- Includes compression for storage efficiency
- Recommended frequency: Daily

### 4. Configuration Backup
- Backs up system settings and environment variables
- Command: `python manage.py backup --type config`
- Recommended frequency: After configuration changes

## Monitoring and Logging
- All backup operations are logged in:
  1. System logs (`logs/backup.log`)
  2. Database (`SystemLog` table)
  3. Admin dashboard
- Failed backups trigger notifications to administrators
- Success/failure status is tracked for each component

## Backup Storage
- Default location: `backups/` directory
- Organized by type and timestamp
- Structure:
  ```
  backups/
  ├── db/
  │   └── backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.sql
  ├── media/
  │   └── backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.tar.gz
  └── config/
      └── backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json
  ```

## Restore Process
1. Access the admin backup dashboard
2. Select the backup to restore
3. Verify backup integrity
4. Initiate restore process
5. Monitor restore progress
6. Verify system functionality

### Restore Commands
```bash
# Full system restore
python manage.py restore --backup-path backups/full_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS

# Database only restore
python manage.py restore --type db --backup-path backups/db/backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.sql

# Media files restore
python manage.py restore --type media --backup-path backups/media/backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.tar.gz
```

## Best Practices
1. Regularly test backup restoration
2. Keep multiple backup generations
3. Monitor backup success/failure
4. Verify backup integrity
5. Document any restore operations

## Troubleshooting
Common issues and solutions:

### 1. Backup Fails
- Check disk space
- Verify database connectivity
- Check file permissions
- Review error logs

### 2. Restore Fails
- Verify backup file integrity
- Check system compatibility
- Ensure sufficient disk space
- Review error logs

## Emergency Procedures
1. Stop application services
2. Perform emergency backup
3. Fix the issue
4. Verify data integrity
5. Restore if necessary
6. Restart services

## Monitoring Dashboard
Access the backup monitoring dashboard at:
`/administration/backup/`

Features:
- Backup status overview
