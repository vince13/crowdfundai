   - Maximum extension: 30 days
   - Minimum 3 notifications during grace period
   - Clear communication of consequences

### Communication Strategy
1. **Payment Failure Notifications**
   - Immediate notification of failure
   - Clear instructions for updating payment method
   - Reminder of grace period duration

2. **Grace Period Communications**
   - Start of grace period notification
   - Mid-period reminder
   - 24-hour warning before expiration
   - Confirmation of successful recovery

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Failed Payment Retry Issues**
